### a bit about me
- she/her, furry
- currently doing homebrew for game boy (dmg, sgb and cgb)
- i also sometimes make animations of.. cats fighting? something like that
- you may see me pop up at game jams from time to time
- any questions? dm me on discord, im online quite often

### this readme contains:
- a very basic intro
- a table of contents thingy (youre reading it)
- portfolio i guess?
- list of things id love to do
- links to my other accounts
- profile pic credits and info
- some bad ascii art

maybe if enough people ask ill add a section for zlago (my character) and
something that goes into way more detail than the `a bit about me` section

### stuff i did
- a snake clone for game boy https://zlago.itch.io/snek-gbc

### would like to do a..
- somewhat lightweight GB/SGB/SNES (maybe also PokeMini) sound driver
- platformer for DMG/SGB/GBC so impressive youd think its a windows game with bad graphics
(doubt itll happen, but hey, you never know..)
- somewhat simple 4 (or more) player homebrew game

### links to socials
- discord : zlago#4821
- itch : https://zlago.itch.io
- mastodon : https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@zlago
- BotB : https://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/zlago/

did i miss anything?

### profile picture
if for any weird reason you would like your art to be my profile pic,
dm me on discord about it, if i like it itll be my discord pfp, maybe
on other platforms too, the github pfp should forever remain as this cat thing.

if i get bored of the same thing i either draw something new or open the
folder full of older pfps i had and choose something

current discord pfp is by Delivery Cat#4561

current discord banner is by `i have no idea, i couldnt find anything`

if my pfp is *not* a white winking cat with rather big ears, a flower on one of em, a green bandana and.. some sort of hairstyle,
all on a pink background, then it likely means i forgot to update the readme, please notify me..

### closing thoughts

here have an awful ascii drawing, i got nothing else to say
