### welcome to the very epic readme
of 5 minutes quality that i likely spent 10 hours on

lets start with the basic stuff
- pronouns     : she/her
- spiecies     : 100% real cat, trust me
- what i do    : a bit of everything, including: sm83asm, tiny pixelart, tiny sketches, chiptune attempts

i want to code funny games for funny handheld known as game boy (*with* a space)

may or may not release those as GPL *just* to annoy the 3 people who would like to reuse that code

i have no idea how to format ~~mega drive~~ markdown.. ill try to make this more readable once i do
