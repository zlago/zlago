### a bit about me
- she/her, furry
- currently doing homebrew for game boy (dmg, sgb and cgb)
- you may see me pop up at game jams from time to time
- feel free to ask me any stupid questions you got, "worst she can do is say no" :3c
- usually online on discord, feel free to dm or ping

### this readme contains:
- a very basic intro
- a table of contents thingy (youre reading it)
- portfolio i guess?
- list of things id love to do
- links to my other accounts (todo: finish the list)
- profile pic credits and info
- bad art at the end

### stuff i did
- a snake clone for game boy https://zlago.itch.io/snek-gbc

### would like to do a..
- somewhat lightweight GB/SGB/SNES (maybe also PokeMini) sound driver
- semi-seamless platformer for GB

### links to socials
- discord : zlago#4821
- itch : https://zlago.itch.io

### profile picture
if for any weird reason you would like your art to be my profile pic,
dm me on discord about it, if i like it itll be my discord pfp, maybe
on other platforms too, the github pfp should forever remain as this cat thing.

if i get bored of the same thing i either draw something new or open the
folder full of older pfps i had and choose something

current discord pfp is by Delivery Cat#4561

current discord banner is by `i have no idea, i couldnt find anything`

if my pfp is *not* a white winking cat with rather big ears, a flower on one of em, a green bandana and.. some sort of hairstyle,
all on a pink background, then it likely means i forgot to update the readme, please notify me..
