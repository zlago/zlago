### a bit about me
- she/her, furry [(more info)](https://en.pronouns.page/@zlago)
- currently doing homebrew for game boy (dmg, sgb and cgb) ~~and famicom/nes~~
- i also sometimes make animations of.. cats fighting? something like that
- you may see me pop up at game jams ~~from time to time~~ ~~if~~ when i get nerd sniped
- any questions? [contact me](#links-to-socialswhatevs)

### this readme contains:
- [a very basic intro](#a-bit-about-me)
- [a table of contents thingy](#this-readme-contains) (youre reading it)
- [portfolio i guess?](#stuff-i-did)
- [list of things id love to do](#would-like-to-do-a) (*not* a todo list)
- [links to my other accounts](#links-to-socialswhatevs)
- [profile pic credits and info](#profile-picture)
- [some bad ascii art](#closing-thoughts)

maybe if enough people ask ill add a section for zlago (me) and zlago (my character)

### stuff i did
- a snake clone for game boy [(itch)](https://zlago.itch.io/snek-gbc)
[(github)](github.com/zlago/snek-gbc) [(homebrew hub)](https://hh.gbdev.io/game/snek-gbc)
- an SGB test rom involving self-writting code [(github)](https://github.com/zlago/sgb-speedtest)
- i have no idea if this should count as something i 'did' [(itch)](https://zlago.itch.io/hell-gbc)
[(github)](https://github.com/zlago/hell-on-earth-gbc)

(github - source code, itch - game "page"/download, homebrew hub - play in browser/download rom)

### would like to do a..
- somewhat lightweight GB/SGB/SNES (maybe also PokeMini) sound driver
- platformer for DMG/SGB/GBC so impressive youd think its a windows game with bad graphics
(doubt itll happen, but hey, you never know..)
- somewhat simple 4 (or more) player famicom game, [doubt ill finish it](github.com/zlago/nes-test) ~~>implying i started working on it~~
- gbc bootrom with some special functions, like forcing a game to run in DMG mode or maybe even writting a DMA hook

### links to socials/whatevs
- discord : zlago#4821 (online often)

- [mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@zlago) (checked once in a while)

please keep in mind that i am awful at starting and carrying
conversations and i will NOT go out of my way to talk to you

(if *you* need/want anything *from me* then i expect *you* to *message me*)

### profile picture
if for any weird reason you would like your art to be my profile pic, dm me
on discord about it, if i like it itll be my discord pfp, maybe on other
platforms too.. but the github pfp shall forever remain as the 2 color 8x8 thing

if youre unsure on how to draw zlago, well i dont really
have a ref sheet but we should be able to figure something out

if i get bored of the same thing i either draw something new or open the
folder full of older pfps i had and choose something, so consider putting
a watermark on your creation

currently my avatar on most things is drawn by Delivery Cat#5934

### closing thoughts

here have an awful ascii drawing, i got nothing else to say
